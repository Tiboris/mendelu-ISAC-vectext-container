Using VecText in classroom Q47
==============================
Download the ZIP archive from UIS and unzip it to a directory, e.g., Z:/VecText. Add the following code to the beginning of files vectext.pl and vectext-cmdline.pl (use the name of the directory where you have unzipped the files):

use lib 'z:/VecText';


Installing VecText elsewhere
============================

Download and install a Perl interpreter from strawberryperl.com.

Then, some modules need to be installed. In the windows command line ("cmd" application), run "cpan install XXX" where for XXX fill in the following module names:

cpan install Tk
cpan install Tk::FileDialog
cpan install Tk::DirSelect
cpan install Tk::Help
cpan install Win32::LongPath
cpan install List::Util
cpan install Cwd
cpan install URI::Find
cpan install Lingua::Stem::Snowball
cpan install Encode::Unicode

In case something is missing, you will see a message "Can't locate XXX.pm in @INC...". Then, install the missing module using the same procedure as above.

Download the ZIP archive from UIS and unzip it to a directory, e.g., Z:/VecText. Add the following code to the beginning of files vectext.pl and vectext-cmdline.pl (use the name of the directory where you have unzipped the files):

use lib 'z:/VecText';

When you run vectext ("perl vectext.pl" in the command line) you will probably see an error related to the FileDialog.pm file. To fix it, edit the file (usually located in c:\strabberry\perl\site\lib\Tk\FileDialog.pm) on lines 696, 697, and 699. A strange symbol after the $ character should be replaced by ^W, so the code there looks as follows:
sub IsNum {
    my($parm) = @_;
    my($warnSave) = $^W;
    $^W = 0;
    my($res) = (($parm + 0) eq $parm);
    $^W = $warnSave;
    return $res;
}

Now, everything should work.
